# Helix MS Build Example  

This solution shows how you can use msbuild and the new dotnetcore project format in a Sitecore Helix solution.  

No Gulp, Grunt, Cake, nant or other task runner beside msbuild. No custom build tasks or required nuget references. 

## The example features

- Automatic publish on builds from Visual Studio
- XML tranformation for config files and other xml on publish
- No dependencies on other than Visual Studio standard build targets
- PackageReferences for all dependencies
- Helix solution and Module templates for the [Sitecore Visual Studio Helix Templates extension](https://www.google.com)

Feedback highly appreciated.
